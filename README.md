# IBM-Cloud-Gallery-Lab
Exploration of numeric, text, and optimisation datasets using IBM Cloud Resource Hub

# 📊 IBM Cloud Gallery Dataset Exploration Lab
This repository contains exploratory data science work based on IBM Cloud Resource Hub datasets. The lab showcases how data scientists use a variety of data types—from purely numeric to mixed text and even geospatial—to derive insights and solve real-world problems.

     🔬 Course Context: This lab was part of a hands-on assignment under IBM's Data Science curriculum.
