# IBM-Cloud-Gallery-Lab
Exploration of numeric, text, and optimisation datasets using IBM Cloud Resource Hub

# 📊 IBM Cloud Gallery Dataset Exploration Lab
This repository contains exploratory data science work based on IBM Cloud Resource Hub datasets. The lab showcases how data scientists use a variety of data types—from purely numeric to mixed text and even geospatial—to derive insights and solve real-world problems.

     🔬 Course Context: This lab was part of a hands-on assignment under IBM's Data Science curriculum.

# 📌 Exercises

## 🧮 Exercise 1: Numeric Dataset – UCI Forest Fires

- Dataset: UCI: [UCI](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/gallery)

- Goal: Predict the burned area of a forest fire using numerical environmental factors.

- Key Features: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, fire indices.

- 🔍 Activities: Data preview, structure analysis, EDA suggestions.




## ✍️ Exercise 2: Mixed Data (Numeric + Text) – Airbnb Trentino Reviews
- Dataset: Airbnb Reviews in Trentino

- Goal: Explore customer behavior and feedback.

- Data Tables: Listings, Reviews, and Calendar.

- 🔍 Activities: Text analysis potential, sentiment analysis, ratings-based filtering.




## 📍 Exercise 3: Jupyter Notebook – Optimal Store Location (Decision Optimisation)
- Notebook Title: Finding optimal locations of new stores using Decision Optimisation

- Tools: Python, IBM Decision Optimisation

- Goal: Minimise the distance between libraries and coffee shops using optimisation models.

- 🔍 Activities: Geospatial data visualisation, modelling, and output interpretation.
